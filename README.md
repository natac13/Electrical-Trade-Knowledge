# Electrical Trade Knowledge

## Introduction

This is my cumulative knowledge of the electrical trade and construction in general. These are things I have come to find important and want to remember. Some of them I have learned the hard way, actually most of them. Others were bestowed upon me by the journeymen I have worked with.

These are the tools I have chosen to use as an
electrician.
