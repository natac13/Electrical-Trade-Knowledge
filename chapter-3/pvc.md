# PVC

## Trench Runs

When running PVC of DB2 in a trench I have found it best to have the *bell end* of the conduit as the *head* of the run. This way, if you are forced to leave the run dead-ended in the ground for future completion, you are taping up the *bell end* of the conduit. Then, when the ends are exposed for completion it is easier to just remove the duct tape and clean the inside of the *bell end*, rather than have to remove the duct tape, fully and clear away the mud from the *non-bell end* to apply the PVC solvent for a adequate seal with the next length of conduit.
