# Steps in Wiring/Landing a Panel of Multiple Branch Circuits

**Step 1**
- Uncoil wire bundles
  + Wipe away any wire pulling lubricant
  + Cut any electrical tape

**Step 2**
- Separate the bond wire from each of the wire bundles entering the panel enclosure. 
- Group the bond wires together with tie-wraps so they form a path to the bond bar. 
- Strip ends no more than the length of the linesmen used or 1/2"
- Land bond wires.

**Step 3**
- Separate the neutral/identified conductors from each of the wire bundles.
- Again group these together and with other neutrals form different wire bundles to form a path to the neutral bar. 
- Cut, relabel and land the neutral wires from the bottom of the neutral bar upwards. 
- After halfway point on the neutral bar, use a 'hand loop' of extra wire.

**Step 4**
- Separate the ungrounded conductors(hots) into two groups, odds to the left and even numbers to the right of the panel.
- Starting with and finishing the odd side—left side—of the panel before moving onto the even side—right side— of the panel.
- Group the odds/evens together neatly with tie-wraps to the point just above the top breaker. 
- Then starting with the back of the newly made bundle select, cut, relabel and land each conductor.
- Use a 'hand loop' of extra to land each conductor. This is the hand width with the thumb pointing upwards, wired looped around hand and the thumb to create a loop and 90 degree angle before landing.
- After finishing the landing of each side neatly 'dress' the 'wire groups' that are formed during the 'hand loop' landing process. Be sure to not bundle the downward portion of the conductor with the upward loop portions. The whole side sure move as one unit once complete. 

**Suggestion of alternative approaches**
- Create a roll up strip of numbers; one for odd and one for even numbers. This is to be placed over top the breakers while landing. The purpose being to delay the relabeling of each conductor until after all landing completed. Thus preventing the switching of tasks. *Note* this can be done without the roll up strip but can lead to errors and some labeling must be done to create the brevity of finding the correct breaker corresponding to the wire to be landed.
