# Conduit Bending

### 90&deg;

|EMT Pipe Size      |Rigid Pipe   |Take up / Deduction   |
|-------------------|-------------|----------------------|
|**1/2"** (12.7mm)  |N/A          |**5"** (127mm)        |
|**3/4"** (19.1mm)  |1/2" (12.7mm)|**6"** (153mm)        |
|**1"** (25.4mm)    |3/4" (19.1mm)|**8"** (203mm)        |
|**1 1/4"** (31.8mm)|1"   (25.4mm)|**12"** (305mm)       |

1. Measure the distance to the back of the 90&deg; bend.
2. Deduct the 'Take Up' on the chart from your measurment in step 1; mark this distance on the conduit
3. Line up your mark with the arrow on the bending shoe.
4. Put a slight bend in the conduit with your hands and upper body. This will help secure the conduit in the bender.
5. Put the shoe and conduit on the floor to use foot pressure to complete the bend.
6. If precision is nessassary then use a level to set the bend at 90&deg;

### Offsets

|Angle of Bend  |Mulitpiler  |Shrinkage / inch of offset depth|
|---------------|------------|--------------------------------|
|10&deg;        |6.0         |1/16" (1.6mm)                   |
|22.5&deg;      |2.6         |3/16" (4.8mm)                   |
|30&deg;        |2.0         |1/4" (6.4mm)                    |
|45&deg;        |1.4         |3/8" (9.5mm)                    |
|60&deg;        |1.2         |1/2" (12.7mm)                   |

1. Measure distance to obstruction; mark this distance on the conduit.
2. Measure back from the step 1 mark the distance found using the above chart, given the amount of offset multiplied by the appropriate multiplier for the respective angle of bends; place the second mark on the conduit.
3. Using the notch bend to the desired angle of bend on each mark.
4. Check the offset measurement and level; adjust when nessassary.

## Bending the 3-point saddle.
### 1. Measure to center of obstruction.
### 2. Calculate shrink based off the height of the obstruction.
### 3. Add shrink to step 1. and mark the center bend.
### 4. Mark return bends based off chart's 'Distance off Center Mark'.
### 5. Center bend aligned to notched and return bends aligned to the arrow on the shoe.
