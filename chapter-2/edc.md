# Everyday Carry Items

The follow is a list of my everyday carry items at work. This has been generated from my apprenticeship with journeymen asking me for items, usually at times prior to opening our tools up or after putting them away.

1. Multi-tool / Pocketknife.
2. Pen, Pencil, and Marker.
3. Electrical Tape.
4. Couple of Marettes.

If you have opened your tool box but are still unsure of the day's task then grab the following items.

1. Linesman pliers.
2. Tape Measure.
3. Multi-bit screwdriver.
4. Non-Contact Voltage Tester

This list I have found to be sufficient enough handle those times which you are planning out jobs either with your foreman or journeyman, or troubleshooting a minor electrical problem, as well as just verifing a circuit is either live or dead.
