# High-Visibility Clothing

Most construction sites I have been on have required high-visibility clothing to be worn at all times; or at least worn while around heavy equipment. I quickly realized that wearing the hi-vis vests are not comfortable and can be dangerous/annoying as it tends to get caught, especially while performing any actual construction work.

The best work clothing I have found is from [Ago Industries][AGO] in London Ontario. Their clothing is made out of 100% cotton or Arc/Flame Resistant(FR) material. They also have the best **price**; they make the clothing on site.

Working in construction I would never recommend anyone to buy the hi-vis clothing made from polyester. This may feel lighter and more breathable, however any sparks from grinding can melt this material; I have seen it happen.
Also being an electrician this is not a wise material to wear. With a bad situation such as an arc flash, polyester will melt to your skin, therefore intensifing the burns received.

In Ontario under the [OHSA 25(1)(a)][https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/90o01#BK47] it is the duty of the employer to *ensure that equipment, material and protective devices as prescribed are provided* Therefore if your job requirements/tasks call for FR rated clothing it will be provided by the employer. It is then the employee's duty to *use or wear the equipment, protective devices and clothing that the worker's employer requires to be worn* [OHSA 28(1)(b)][https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/90o01#BK51].

With the above in mind I buy for myself the 100% cotton material.
