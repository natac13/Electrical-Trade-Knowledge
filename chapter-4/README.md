# Fire Alarm

This guide is from my experience working for Tilco on a high rise building's fire alarm system. 

The fire alarm brand was Simplex/Tyco. The devices had an eight bit dip switch addressing system. I was tasked with addressing each device and had the freedom to choose the addresses myself. The Tyco programmer mentioned that normally they would supply the addresses on a print for each device; the electrician would then address each device according to the given print.

I learned that each addressable loop, the addresses can be reset back to 1. At the time I was unsure and so was my foreman so we decided to do the addressing by node; the building had a 2 node system, Garage to 8 and 9 to 14 respectively.
