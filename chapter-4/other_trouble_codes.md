# Other Trouble Codes

Other *Trouble* codes on the fire alarm panel that I have seen and how to clear them. These are the ones that I can remember; however I believe there was one more code that the electrician can fix, Bad Device maybe...

**Bad Address**
Usually means a duplicate address as another device. Usually the electrician's issue by having two devices with the same address. However this can be the programmer's issue if they programmed the panel with duplicate addresses.

**Wrong Device**
This means that the address given corresponds to a device type that is different from what was programmed into the panel. This could be the electrician's issue or the programmers issue, either by addressing the wrong device, or programming the wrong device-address combination respectively.

**Missing Head**
A smoke or heat detector is missing its head or the head is not properly attached to the base.
